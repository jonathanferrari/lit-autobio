    <h1>Early Adulthood: Making Change with Literacy</h1><br/>
    <par>At the start of my college education, I decided that I ought to study literature again; I owed it to my child self who fell in love with the worlds created on pages. Luckily for me, there was a class that focused on literature, specifically ancient
        Greek and Roman writings, at Berkeley; the class was called Classics R44: Roots of Western Civilization. One piece of literature that I will focus on was a story I had read as a child: Homer&rsquo;s Odyssey.

    <par>While the content and deeper meaning of the poem are incredibly important in their own rights, in this class we focused on the effect that the story had on the real world, how the people of the time were influenced and affected by the poem itself.
        In my previous studies, I had always analyzed and interpreted stories in one of two respects. First, in my younger years, I looked at literature as existing in a vacuum &ndash;not tied to any specific point in history; in a word: timeless. Later,
        I began to think about literature as a reflection of the times; stories represented ideas of the time at which they were written, and the content of the stories was heavily impacted by the time and location in which the piece was written.</par>
    <par>However, in Classics R44, I began to practice viewing literature in a more complex, more realistic light. Not only is literature impacted and influenced by the times of its creation, but it also has impact and influence on those very same times. I
        will examine a bit of a case study, one which we covered in that class, the previously mentioned Odyssey. I won&rsquo;t go over the content of the story in this writing but will examine it in the code below. In this section, I will look at the
        impact which the poem had upon the Ancient Greek world. There are two main aspects with respect to which Odysseyinfluenced society; the first is by changing societal values, the second is by creating and bringing importance to professions of the
        literate.</par>
    <par>Homer&rsquo;s famous poem was so impactful that it actually changed the ways in which Greeks of the time lived their lives. The poem portrays the main character, Ulysses, as an honorable and heroic man, though not incredibly different from the average
        Greek citizen of the time. Thus, to the people of Ancient Greece, Ulysses became a symbol of the behavior of an ideal man. In historical writings which record many events such as wars after the writing of Odyssey, people such as generals, kings,
        and other important historical figures were recorded to have referenced Ulysses in making some of their important decisions. In this way, Homer&rsquo;s work directly influenced the path that the ancient world embarked upon. </par>
    <par>While this importance should not be understated, the poem also brought about other changes in value, namely the value placed upon literacy. At the time, not many of the citizens of Greece were literate, at least by the definition of being able to
        read written language. In the time after Homer finished writing Odyssey, the profession of Bardbecame increasingly important, and the people of the time put lots of value on the profession of storytelling, which required literacy. These bardswould
        travel from village to village to tell the story of Ulysses, and were graciously welcomed by the residents of each of the towns. It was not uncommon for these bards to receive free room and board in addition to payment for reciting them poem .
        Thus, the people of the time, directly or indirectly, highly valued literacy. </par>
    <par>This occurrence is an example of a famous metaphor for literature, pioneered by Sylvia Scrbner, that of Literacy as a State of Grace. In her words,
    </par>
    <br/><quo>&ldquo;In the literacy-as-a-state-of-grace concept, the power and functionality of literacy is not bounded by political or economic parameters but in a sense transcends them; the literate individual&iacute;s life derives its meaning and significance
        from intellectual [and] aesthetic &hellip; participation in the accumulated creations and knowledge of humankind, made available through the written word.&rdquo; <br/> - (Scribner, 1984)
    </quo><br/>

    <par>As Scribner suggests, those who were literate in this time not only transcended other values of the time with literacy, but the common citizen also recognized the value in the academic, the historical, and the divine.</par>
