<h1>Multimodality</h1><br/>
<par>My name is Jonathan, and this is a story of my ongoing journey of becoming literate. However, as you may have noticed, this story has a bit of a twist in its presentation. This is going to be a meta-exploration of my literacy journey.</par>
<par>I will be telling the story of my literacy, specifically in relation to particular books, and the roles they played in my literary development. However, I will also be incorporating elements of another type of literacy: Data and Computer Science . Through
    my fieldwork, I investigate literacy through the lens of students learning Data Science. I have a passion for Data Science and Computer Science, and it too is a type of literacy. So, I thought it fitting to tell a story of my literary journey while
    using another form of my literacy to add another level of literary exploration. As such, this entire Multimodal Autobiography has been written using a mixture of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. </par>

<h1>Purpose and Goals</h1><br/>
<par>Through this autobiography I hope to give the reader insights into my experience in becoming literate. Because this is a huge story to cover, I will focus on my literary journey through specific experiences and pieces of literature that I feel are especially
    relevant and meaningful in telling the story of my ongoing literacy journey.</par>
<par>As mentioned above, I have chosen to incorporate one of my additional modes as pieces of code, and another as text and images that have been styled and rendered using code. I have chosen to incorporate these modes as they are incredibly important to who
    I am today, as I practice computer science throughout my life. Furthermore, I am also currently on a journey of becoming literate in coding languages. Finally, this mode adds to the autobiography as I have been engaging with course material in relation
    to my fieldwork, which takes place in the context of Computer and Data Science education.</par>
<par>I hope that by reading my literacy autobiography, the reader will be able to experience with me some of the defining moments of my journey and be able to understand a little bit more about who I am today, and why literacy is important to me. </par>

<h1>Introduction and Context</h1><br/>
<par>While this is my story, it would be remiss of me to not mention my family, who are the reason I have such a passion for literacy and reading. My household was one which encouraged me to always further my education, and my vocabulary, and generally one
    which fostered learning and allowed me to become the person I am today.</par>
<par>My mother is an elementary school teacher, so education is naturally very important to her. She always pushed me to read as much as I could. She herself was an avid reader and loved fiction as she felt it was an escape from the sometimes bleak realities
    of the world (of course she did not tell me this reasoning as a child). I was extremely lucky to have such a parent figure in my life who encouraged me throughout my development to expand my horizons and learn new things. </par>
<par>As I mentioned earlier, my mother is a schoolteacher. She taught quite far from where we lived so she commutedeach day. One unique aspect of my childhood is that I commuted with her every day, as I went to the same school where she taught. This commute
    was about 45 minutes each way, so about an hour and a half each day. It was during this time that I was able to transport myself to far-off places with my head buried in my books. Because I had so much time to read, I read quite a few books. I remember
    making trips to the library most weekends, to pick out a few new books which I could read the coming week. </par>
<par>With the perfect combination of an encouraging mother, the free time to read, and access to almost unlimited books at the library and at home, it is no wonder I developed a love of reading and that this translates to a passion for literacy.</par>
<par>My maternal grandfather (my mother&rsquo;s father) was also a key figure in my literacy journey. While my mother encouraged me to read for pleasure, he encouraged me to read to learn new things. One such example of this that I can remember vividly happened
    while I was in elementary school. My grandparents lived very close to my family, so I visited quite often. One time in particular I asked my grandfather about how clocks work. He was one of the smartest people I have ever met, and so I always went
    to him with any questions I had about the world. He said, &ldquo;Give me one minute, I&rsquo;ll be right back&rdquo;. He went to his study and returned with a large, colorful book. This book has become one of my all-time favorite pieces of literature.
    The book was called The Way Things Work; it taught about how basic machinery, such as clocks, work, as well as explained some simple physics relating to these machines. My grandfather flipped to the middle of the book, and read aloud the section on
    how (analog) clocks work. When I was leaving, my grandfather said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget this!&rdquo;, and handed me that book. </par>
<par>Unfortunately, about five years ago, my grandfather passed away from medical complications. However, The Way Things Workstill lives on as a symbol that to me, represents one of the greatest men I have ever known. While the book has a special place in
    my heart and memories, it also has a special place on my bookshelf. In fact, I can see it now from my desk where I am writing this. As this special memory shows, literacy can form strong emotional connections between individuals and strengthen already
    existing ones. </par>
