<h1>
    Childhood: Discovery of Interests</h1><br/>
<par>While I had many people to encourage me to read, eventually I began to form my own interest in reading; for instance, as a young child, I had a fascination with Greek Mythology, which I will speak about later in this section. This section will explore
    the story of how this, one of my first original literary interests, came to be.</par>
<par>During the summers I would sometimes spend all day reading. My local library hosted an event each summer that I waited for all year. It was a competition to see which children from the community could read the most books. They had rewards for reading
    a certain number of books over the summer. One prize, for instance, was a free ticket to UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Lawrence Hall of Science; to get this you had to read 20 books over the course of the summer. The library didn&rsquo;t expect many kids to
    complete this task, and in fact, few did; to my knowledge only about 10 of us did. However, I was a bit of an outlier that they didn&rsquo;t account for. I remember one of these summers quite vividly.</par>
<par>I was about ten years old at the time; I was ready to take on the challenge. That summer I read the required 20 books within the first 3 weeks (granted they weren&rsquo;t long books). I went into the library and asked if I could enter the program again
    and read 20 more books. The librarian was a bit hesitant but allowed me to get a new record tracking sheet. The librarian was a bit more hesitant the second time this happened&hellip;and the third and fourth times as well. I tried for a fifth, but
    I didn&rsquo;t quite make it to 100 books by the time the summer was over.</par>
<par>Regardless, by early August, I had accrued four free tickets to the Lawrence Hall of Science, which soon became one of my favorite attractions in the Bay Area, which is where my family is from. Because my mother was a teacher, we both had a few weeks
    off before school started back up. So, my mother took me, four days in a row, to the science exhibits at the Lawrence Hall of Science, where it feels like I saw everything they had to offer. It was here that one of my other academic interests developed,
    that of the physical sciences.</par>
<par>As an aside, it was during this week that I decided I wanted to attend UC Berkeley once I graduated high school, and here I am today. This is just one example of how literacy can change a person&rsquo;s life in immense ways, even if the effects seem small
    at the time. I&rsquo;m not sure if I would be here today if I had not participated in that contest.</par>
<par>While I explored many exhibits at the museum, there was one that piqued my interest above the others; at the time, it was called Posiden&rsquo;s Rivers. In the exhibit, there were multiple boards you could place at different parts of the exhibit which
    changed the flow of the water in sometimes unpredictable ways. This naming was a bit fortuitous, as one of the ways I read so many books that summer was that I read lots of Greek Mythology from my local library.</par>
<par>I was fascinated by the awesome tales of Gods, Heroes, and the underlying lessons in such stories. That summer and over the following years, I read many pieces of Greek Mythology (which were simplified for children), including The Tale of Prometheus,
    Pandora&rsquo;s Box, The Tale of The Minotaur, and my personal favorite Daedalus and Icarus. In case you are unfamiliar with the tale of Icarus, here is a brief synopsis of the fable:</par>
<quo><br/>&ldquo;According to the story, Daedalus, a mythical inventor, created wings made of feathers and wax to escape from Crete where he and his son, Icarus, were held captive by King Minos. Icarus, however, ignored his father&#39;s warnings and flew too close
    to the sun. His wings melted and he fell into the sea where he met his end&rdquo; <br/>- <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thecollector.com/daedalus-and-icarus/%23:~:text%3DAccording%2520to%2520the%2520story%252C%2520Daedalus,where%2520he%2520met%2520his%2520end.&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1678860838973008&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ESb7HXOaWea3ZskpqU2R7">(Chaliakopoulos, 2021)</a>
</quo><br/>
<par>The story is significant in my literacy journey because it is the first text I recall reading where I was truly able to glean a meaningful moral from the story on my own. While I, in the 21 stcentury, am able to learn lessons from this text, it also taught
    similar lessons to those who read or listened to the story during the period in which this story was written. Further, this text did not exist in a vacuum; many other texts were written in the same time period and contained similar ideas. James Gee
    would define this group of literary works as a &ldquo;Discourse&rdquo;. In his own words, Gee defines Discourse as, </par>
<quo><br/>&ldquo;a socially accepted association among ways of using language, of thinking, and of acting that can be used to identify oneself as a member of a socially meaningful group or &lsquo;social network&rsquo;&rdquo; &ndash; (Gee, 1989)
</quo><br/>
    <par>As I mentioned earlier, this story, in particular, contains a very prominent moral: that you should not strive for things beyond your means or beyond what is reasonable and expected. Thinking about the time when this was written, it is very possible that this moral served a purpose, and that other pieces of literature within the discourse contained similar morals. One property that Gee mentions about Discourses is that they are, </par>
    <quo><br/>&ldquo;inherently &lsquo;ideological&rsquo;. They crucially involve a set of values and viewpoints in terms of which one must speak and act, at least while being in the discourse, otherwise one doesn&rsquo;t count as being in it.&rdquo; <br/>&ndash; (Gee,
        1989)
    </quo><br/>

    <par>In particular, the set of ideologies represented by this discourse likely served as a way of suppressing desires for social change or social mobility, thus stabilizing the class hierarchy of the ancient European world at the time. By showing the misfortune
        which befalls Icarus, the story discourages ambition and desires for more, which is consistent with other works of the time such as morals from stories like that of King Midas.
