    <h1>Adolescence: Deeper Levels of Making Meaning</h1><br/>
    <par>I continued my interest in literacy until now, however, high school contained a few other relevant experiences that altered the path I followed in my journey. In high school, I took Advanced Placement Language and Composition, where some of my most
        important literary education took place. In this class, we took part in many activities, such as reading and analyzing famous texts, investigating the origins and contexts of words, and expanding our vocabularies. However, there was one task that
        I feel caused a paradigmatic shift in the way I viewed literature. </par>
    <par>This task was analyzing the symbols in the novel The Great Gatsby. We had just finished reading the book over the past few weeks. The rest of the following two weeks was dedicated to looking at the deeper meanings of the text as a class. We had all
        read the novel on our own time &ndash; a few chapters each week as homework. This task forced us to look at the text from the perspective of a few of our classmates.</par>
    <par>For a little bit of context, I did not perform the best academically in this class; though I had great interest, it seemed that other students were able to grasp the content we learned much more quickly and much more easily than I could. However,
        I was still interested in what we learned. </par>
    <par>In the task, we first broke into small groups of about three or four students, and shared some of our perspectives on the novel, and some of our thoughts about the symbols that are present in the novel. I had really liked the book, but compared to
        many of my classmates, I only looked at the book on a surface level. To me it was an intriguing story about fabulous wealth, extravagant parties, and an unrequited love. However, many of my classmates had reflections based on symbols such as the
        use of the color gold to represent wealth and power, the green light representing envy and jealousy, among other things. </par>
    <par>When my classmates provided their interpretations, it was sort of like a light bulb going off in my mind, as if things had just clicked. It was then that I began to view literature not just as a pastime but as sending a deeper message, one more intricate
        and intertwined with human behavior and ideas that I had originally imagined. When I walked into Mr. Standin&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup> period AP Literature class that day, literature was simply a collection of stories told for enjoyment. When I left room 402,
        literature was a way to convey meaning, lessons, messages, thoughts, ideas, passions, and an infinite amount of other constructs.</par>
    <par>While this was sort of a &ldquo;literary awakening&rdquo; for me, it was also an positive example of a critical theory in Education &ndash; Vygotsky&rsquo;s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). In his own words, Vygotsky defines the ZPD as, </par>
    <br/><quo>&ldquo;...the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.
        &hellip; The [ZPD] defines those functions that have not yet matured but are in the process of maturation &hellip; . These functions could be termed the buds or flowers of development rather than the &quot;fruits&quot; of development. The actual
        developmental level characterizes mental development retrospectively, while the zone of proximal development characterizes mental development prospectively.&rdquo; <br/> - (Vygotsky, 1930)</quo><br/>

    <par>Vygotsky would have said that the understanding of deeper meaning in literacy was inside of my ZPD. Independently, I was unable to come up with these ideas or reflections, however in a group, I was able to see what was there, hidden between the lines
        on the pages. This type of education allowed me to progress much farther in my studies of literacy than independent study would have allowed me to, and therefore emphasizes and illustrates the importance of social learning to allow for learning
        within students&rsquo; ZPDs.
