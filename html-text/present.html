    <h1>Present Day: Lessons and Looking Forward</h1><br/>
    <par>Having examined my literacy journey over quite the length of time, and quite the range of skills, there is one lesson that I can take away from this Autobiography. That is: I am never done learning, even if I think I know it all, especially then,
        I must continue to learn whatever I can about literacy, and to seek out new ways of making meaning out of literature and literacy. </par>
    <par>Moving forward, I will continue to approach my literacy journey with an open mind, ready to learn more about the infinite importances, intricacies, and implications of literacy, and how it permeates every aspect of my life.</par>
